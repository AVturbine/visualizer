# visualizer
A visualizer for AVBotz Marlin's localization system.

Used to get a good understanding of what our Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) system is doing by fetching particles and probabilities from the sub (by ssh'ing debug output to a named pipe on my computer, then reading from it). Uses matplotlib to render plot.
